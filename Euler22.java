   Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...')
   , a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names
   , begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. 
   Then working out the alphabetical value for each name
   , multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
   
   For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order
   , COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. 
   So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 � 53 = 49714.
   
   What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
